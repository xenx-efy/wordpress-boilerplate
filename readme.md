## Installation

1. Install bedrock dependencies includes wordpress core

   Run:
   ```shell
   docker-compose run bedrock-composer composer install
   ```

2. Install theme dependencies

   Run:
   ```shell
   docker-compose run theme-composer composer install
   ```

3. Install theme node dependencies

   Run inside theme:
   ```shell
   npm install 
   ```

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and specify db connection parameters
   (you can find them into docker-compose.yml file in db service)
   It looks like this:

    - MYSQL_DATABASE=mysql
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=hola
    - MYSQL_USER=mysql
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysql

5. Apply `sudo chmod 777 -R src` on src directory. It should prevent errors when you'll change theme.

6. Go to [http://localhost](http://localhost)
   If you want to have custom local domain you can find this
   inside `<project_root>/etc/nginx/default.template.conf` `server_name` parameter.
   Add after changing add this domain to `/etc/hosts` file like here `127.0.0.1 sage.loc`

> Don't change `default.conf`, this files changes by docker!
